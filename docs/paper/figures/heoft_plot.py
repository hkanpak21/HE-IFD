"""Plot style for the experiments section.

One import, one palette, one figure size. Every plot in the paper and in the
technical report goes through this module, so a font size is decided once.

    import heoft_plot as hp
    fig, ax = hp.panels(4)                 # the full-width four-panel figure
    ...
    hp.save(fig, "fig_trends.pdf")

Sizes come from ../.paper-meta.yml, measured off IEEEtran with the journal
option. A label in a saved figure is 8pt on the page, the same size as the
caption beneath it, because the figure is saved at its final width and included
with no width option. Never pass width= to \\includegraphics for these, and
never \\resizebox them. Both rescale the fonts and the plot stops matching the
paper.

Put as little text inside a plot as possible. A panel carries its axis labels
and its data. Everything else goes to the legend or to the caption, and the
caption states the comparison and the conditions and nothing else. Comment and
analysis belong in the body of the section.
